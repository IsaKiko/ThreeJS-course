notes:

* reference frustrum image: https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/opengl/CG_BasicsTheory.html
* explain renderer.domElement better (by looking at the dev tools)
* mention the makeAxes.js file

* explain THREE.Vector3( 100, 10, 10 ) ); first, then 
* console.log camera.position (also a THREE.Vector3); then
* set using camera.position.set(100, 10, 10)

* camera.position: where it is
* camera.lookAt: where to look at 
* alternatively: change rotation : added to main.js - add code to lesson 7

* remove console.log('done') and have it in loading instead
* make dependency tree.. what needs to be set up first before rendering
